1. Make organization names clickable in search results
2. Create dedicated profile pages with comprehensive data
3. Display organization lobbying analytics and trends
4. Enable easy navigation between search and profiles
5. Maintain mobile-responsive design standards

### Success Metrics
- [ ] 100% of organization names are clickable
- [ ] Profile pages load in <2 seconds
- [ ] Charts render correctly on all breakpoints
- [ ] Zero regressions in existing search functionality

## 📊 Prerequisites Assessment

### ✅ Infrastructure Ready
- **Zustand State Management**: Implemented and operational (Phase 2b.2)
- **Recharts Visualization**: Installed and configured (Phase 2c)
- **Mobile-First CSS**: Complete responsive framework (Phase 2d)
- **React Router DOM**: v6.8.0 installed and configured
- **API Client**: Performance-optimized with caching (Phase 2e)

### ✅ Component Foundation

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Component Hierarchy
```
<App>
  └── <Route path="/organization/:organizationName">
        └── <OrganizationProfile>
              ├── <OrganizationHeader />
              ├── <ActivitySummary>
              │     └── <LobbyTrendsChart />
              ├── <OrganizationActivityList />
              ├── <LobbyistNetwork />
              └── <RelatedOrganizations />
```

### State Management Pattern
```javascript
// organizationStore.js
{
  currentOrganization: null,
  organizationData: {},
  loading: false,
  error: null,

  // Actions
  setCurrentOrganization: (orgName) => {...},
  loadOrganizationData: (orgName) => {...},
  clearOrganizationData: () => {...},

  // Selectors
  getSpendingTrends: (state) => {...},
  getTopLobbyists: (state) => {...},
  getRecentActivities: (state) => {...}
}
```

### Routing Configuration
```javascript
// App.js
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Dashboard />} />
  <Route path="/search" element={<Search />} />
  <Route path="/organization/:organizationName" element={<OrganizationProfile />} />
  {/* existing routes */}
</Routes>
```
