## üéØ STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Recommendation 1: Prioritize Landing Page Implementation
**Rationale**: With three complete design options available, implementing the landing page will significantly improve first-time user experience and project professionalism.

**Recommended Design**: Option 1 (Clean & Professional)
- Fastest implementation (2-3 days)
- Strong trust-building for target audience
- Easiest to maintain
- Professional appearance

**Alternative**: If more engagement needed, Option 3 (Interactive Engagement)

### Recommendation 2: Complete Backend Integration
**Rationale**: Moving from demo mode to production data will enable real-world usage and testing.

**Priority Actions**:
1. Implement organization profile API endpoints
2. Connect to BigQuery for real data
3. Test with production data
4. Monitor performance

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 days

### Recommendation 3: Expand Testing Coverage
**Rationale**: Current testing is basic. Comprehensive tests will ensure reliability and catch issues before production.

**Testing Priorities**:
1. Unit tests for all components
2. Integration tests for critical workflows
3. E2E tests for user journeys
4. Performance testing

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days

### Recommendation 4: Set Production Launch Date
**Rationale**: With 95% completion, setting a launch date will focus remaining work and create momentum.

**Suggested Timeline**:
- **Week 1**: Landing page + backend integration (4-5 days)
- **Week 2**: Testing + performance monitoring (3-4 days)
- **Week 3**: User acceptance testing + bug fixes (3-5 days)
- **Week 4**: Production launch + post-launch monitoring

**Total Time to Launch**: 3-4 weeks
